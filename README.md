# IOTA-Paper-Wallet
This utility is for the use of generating paper wallets for IOTA.<br>
All resources are local, and the only two dependies for this utility are <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/qrious">qrious</a>, and <a href = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.js">iota.utils</a>
<br>

To build your own offline copy of the website, run<br>
