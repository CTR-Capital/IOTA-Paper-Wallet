# IOTA-Paper-Wallet
This utility is for the use of generating paper wallets for IOTA.<br>
All resources are local, and the only two dependies for this utility are <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/qrious">qrious</a>, and <a href = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.js">iota.utils</a>
<br>

To build your own offline copy:<br>
* Locate and open the folder ~/IOTA-Paper-Wallet/out/<br>
* If there is a ZIP file, then delete<br>

Then in a terminal window then run:
>npm install <enter>

and then <br>

>npm run build <enter>

A ZIP file labled, "offline-build.zip" will be created in the **~/IOTA-Paper-Wallet/out** folder<br>
